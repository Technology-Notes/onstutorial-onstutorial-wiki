__TOC__

Now, let's move on building a networking application. 

In this exercise, we provide you with starter code for a hub controller, which inefficiently copies packets to every port.  First, you'll verify that this controller works and test its performance.

In Phase 1, you'll modify this provided hub to act as an L2 learning switch.  An L2 learning switch learns the mapping between MAC addresses and ports by watching packets.  If the switch has already seen a particular destination, it can send to exactly one port; otherwise it must flood the packet out all ports, like a hub.

In Phase 2, you'll turn the learning switch into a flow-based switch, where seeing a packet with a known source and destination causes a flow entry to get pushed down.  With a flow-based switch, further packets in the flow are handled in the dataplane, and they avoid the expensive hop to the controller and back.

For this tutorial you'll use the Beacon controller.  The same concepts learned here apply to other OpenFlow controller platforms, and your Mininet-based VM provides a nice environment to continue with after this tutorial.

== Beacon (Java) ==
Beacon is a Java-based OpenFlow controller platform.  For more details and tutorials see the [[Beacon Homepage|http://www.beaconcontroller.net]]. 

=== Start Eclipse ===
Start Eclipse by double clicking the Eclipse shortcut on the desktop.

=== Run the Tutorial Controller ===

Make sure the reference controller used before is not running, run the following in a terminal:
 $ sudo killall controller

You should also restart Mininet to make sure that everything is "clean". From your Mininet console:
 mininet> exit
 $ sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote

Make sure you do not add extra spaces around the comma.

Now, start Beacon in Debug mode.

Within Eclipse do the following:

* Run -> Debug Configurations
* Look for the OSGi Framework on the left, expand its children and select 'beacon Tutorial LearningSwitch', then click Debug.

This command will start Beacon, including the 'tutorial' bundle, listening to incoming connection from switches on the standard OpenFlow port (6633).  Alternately, you can click on the bug icon near the top left of the toolbar to start debugging.

Wait until the application indicates that the OpenFlow switch has connected.  When the switch connects, your Eclipse console should print something like this: 

01:07:31.095 [pool-2-thread-2] INFO  n.b.core.internal.Controller - Switch connected from java.nio.channels.SocketChannel[connected local=/192.168.206.2:6633 remote=/192.168.206.4:54994]

=== Verify Hub Behavior with tcpdump ===

Now we verify that hosts can ping each other, and that all hosts see the exact same traffic - the behavior of a hub.  To do this, we'll create xterms for each host, and view the traffic in each.  In the Mininet console, start up three xterms:
 mininet> xterm h1 h2 h3

Arrange each xterm so that they're all on the screen at once.  This may require reducing the height of to fit a cramped laptop screen.

In the xterms for h2 and h3, run tcpdump, a utility to print the packets seen by a host, and ignore IPv6 packets:
 # tcpdump -XX -n not ip6

In the xterm for h1, send a ping:
 # ping -c1 10.0.0.2

The ping packets are now going up to the controller, which then floods them out all interfaces except the sending one.   You should see identical ARP and ICMP packets corresponding to the ping in both xterms running tcpdump.

Now, see what happens when a non-existent host doesn't reply.  From h2 xterm:
 # ping -c1 10.0.0.5

You should see three unanswered ARP requests in the tcpdump xterms.  If your code is off later, three unanswered ARP requests is a signal that you might be accidentally dropping packets.

You can close the xterms now.

=== Benchmark Hub Controller w/iperf ===
Here, you'll benchmark the provided hub code, part of the Tutorial bundle.

First, verify reachability.  Mininet should be running, along with your Beacon tutorial controller.  In the Mininet console, run:
 mininet> pingall

This is just a sanity check for connectivity.  Now, in the Mininet console, run:
 mininet> iperf

Now, compare your number with the reference controller you saw before. How does that compare?

=== Open Tutorial Code and Begin ===

Go to Eclipse and stop Beacon (you should see a square, red button in the console window, or the top left section of Eclipse if you are in the Debug perspective).

'''NOTE : You can run only one controller at the same time (otherwise you'll get a port conflict). Make sure that you stop any running instance of Beacon before you start another one. With Eclipse this might be tricky. To check the running programs open the Debug perspective (Window->Open Perspective->Debug). On the top-left corner you can see the running programs, click on it then hit the red square to terminate the redundant ones...'''

The file you'll modify is called LearningSwitchTutorial.java.  It is located at:
'''net.beaconcontroller.tutorial/src/main/java/net/beaconcontroller/tutorial/LearningSwitchTutorial.java'''.

If this file is not already open in Eclipse, find it in the left pane of Eclipse and double-click it to open it in the editor window.

After opening the file, you may want to compress the left pane of Eclipse to free up some screen space, as you won't need to open any additional files in Eclipse.  Click the Minimize button at the top right of the left pane, which looks like a dash.

To jump between functions more quickly, you may want to expand the right pane to get the Outline view.  Click the Restore button at the top right of the right pane, which looks like two stacked windows.

Take a quick look through the file.  The key things to notice:
* The receive method is where packets initially arrive from switches, and by default this method calls forwardAsHub.  Once you have implemented the code in forwardAsLearningSwitch you should change receive by commenting out the call to forwardAsHub, and uncommenting the call to forwardAsLearningSwitch.
* The forwardAsHub method behaves as a broadcast hub, and has code that gives you an example of how to send an OFPacketOut message.
* The forwardAsLearningSwitch method is where you will be writing all of your code (with the exception of the receive method mentioned earlier).  It should take you around 30 lines of code in this method to implement a learning switch.

Use Wireshark to inspect the packets sent and received by your controller to help debug your code.

API documentation is available for both Beacon's classes and the general Java classes, look for the shortcuts on your desktop to launch a browser to view these.


Each time you change and save the LearningSwitchTutorial file, make sure to stop and start your running instance, then use pings to verify hub or Ethernet learning switch behavior.  Hosts that are not the destination should display no tcpdump traffic after the initial broadcast ARP request.

There is a significant number of comments in the LearningSwitchTutorial file to help you create the proper functionality, and tips provided in the subsequent sections of this tutorial ('''read these!''').  At a high level there are two phases of work, and two optional (and independent) extra credit sections:

==== Phase 1 ====
----
===== Phase 1 - Overview =====
This tutorial will walk you through the steps to complete each of the following tasks:
* Change to the forwardAsSwitch function
* Build an OFMatch object based on the incoming OFPacketIn
* Learn that the source MAC address is at the incoming port and store it in the Map
* Retrieve the port the destination MAC address is at, if it is known
* If the destination port is known, send an OFPacketOut directly and only to that port, else forward using the flooding method in the forwardAsHub method

At the end of this phase you should be able to send pings back and forth, and in Wireshark you should see an initial OFPacketOut in both directions with its action set to flood, subsequent OFPacketOut messages should have their action set to send to a single port.

===== Phase 1 - Tips =====
* To log a message to the console
<dl><dd><pre>
log.debug("Your message here")
</pre></dd></dl>

* The ''OFMatch'' class can be used to retrieve packet header data contained in the ''OFPacketIn'' class.  The following command will return a new ''OFMatch'' object containing data from the ''OFPacketIn'' pi object.
<dl><dd><pre>
 match.loadFromPacket(pi.getPacketData(), pi.getInPort()); 
</pre></dd></dl>

* The following command shows how to add an element to a Map
<dl><dd><pre>
 macTable.put(mac_address_key, port)
</pre></dd></dl>

* The macTable Map object is keyed by the ''Long'' data type, but MAC addresses in the ''OFMatch'' class are byte[].  The following command will take a byte[] from the match object and return a Long:
<dl><dd><pre>
 Ethernet.toLong(match.getDataLayerSource())
</pre></dd></dl>

* You can also convert a byte[] to a String for easy logging:
<dl><dd><pre>
log.debug("MAC Address:" + HexString.toHexString(match.getDataLayerSource()))
</pre></dd></dl>

* To check for an element in your HashMap:
<dl><dd><pre>
 if (macTable.containsKey(mac_address_key)) {
   do..something..here
 }
</pre></dd></dl>

* To get an element from the HashMap:
<dl><dd><pre>
 learned_port = macTable.get(mac_address_key)
</pre></dd></dl>

===== Phase 1 - Testing =====
* Start Beacon
* Start Wireshark and turn on its capturing
* Start Mininet
 $ sudo mn --topo single,2 --switch ovsk --controller remote
* Wait for Beacon's console to report the switch has connected
* Send a single ping from h1 to h2 
 mininet> h1 ping -c1 h2
* Check that the ping was successful
 PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=1.68 ms

 --- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
 rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.683/1.683/1.683/0.000 ms

* Switch to your Wireshark view, find the first Packet Out in the top pane, select it, then expand the OpenFlow Protocol section at the bottom until you get to the Action's output port.  The first Packet Out's output port should be Flood, as seen in this screenshot:
<a href="images/phase1-test1.png" target="_blank">[[images/phase1-test1.png]]</a>

* Subsequent Packet Out actions should be directed to a single port, to indicate the switch is learning properly, as seen in this screenshot:
<a href="images/phase1-test2.png" target="_blank">[[images/phase1-test2.png]]</a>

==== Phase 2 ====
----
===== Phase 2 - Overview =====
* If the destination port is known, instead of sending an OFPacketOut, send an OFFlowMod so that subsequent pings are matched on the switch.

At the end of phase 2, when pinging and viewing the controller traffic in Wireshark you should see an initial OFPacketOut that floods for the request/response, then an OFFlodMod being sent for both request/response, then no further traffic for the same ping.

===== Phase 2 - Tips =====
* To install a flow in the network you will create an ''OFFlowMod'' object:
<dl><dd><pre>
 OFFlowMod fm = new OFFlowMod();
</pre></dd></dl>

* Before you can send the ''OFFlowMod'' to the switch you will need to initialize the following fields of the object:
** buffer id - Retrieve this from the ''OFPacketIn''
** match - You created this in Phase 1
** command - Add, OFFlowMod.OFPFC_ADD
** idle timeout - 5 seconds
** actions - See the next Tip

* You ''OFFlowMod'' when matched should output to the port learned for this destination, use the snippet below to create the action and set it on the ''OFFlowMod'' instance:
<dl><dd><pre>
 OFActionOutput action = new OFActionOutput(outPort);
 fm.setActions(Collections.singletonList((OFAction)action));
</pre></dd></dl>

* To send a message to an OpenFlow switch do the following:
<dl><dd><pre>
 sw.getOutputStream().write(po);
</pre></dd></dl>

===== Phase 2 - Testing =====
* Start Beacon
* Start Wireshark and turn on its capturing
* Start Mininet
 $ sudo mn --topo single,2 --switch ovsk --controller remote
* Wait for Beacon's console to report the switch has connected
* Send a single ping from h1 to h2 
 mininet> h1 ping -c1 h2
* Check that the ping was successful
 PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=1.68 ms

 --- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
 rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.683/1.683/1.683/0.000 ms

* Switch to your Wireshark view.  You should see an initial Packet In/Out for the first ARP request where the switch does not know where the destination is at.  All subsequent Packet Ins should have a corresponding Flow Mod, but no Packet Out.  An example can be seen in the following screenshot:
<a href="images/phase2-test1.png" target="_blank">[[images/phase2-test1.png]]</a>

==== Extra Credit 1 ====
----
===== Extra Credit 1 - Overview =====
Your learning switch so far only supports a single switch, with a single MAC table.  In this section, you'll extend it to support multiple switches.

Start mininet with a different topology.  In the Mininet console:
 mininet> exit
 $ sudo mn --topo linear --switch ovsk --controller remote

Your created topology looks like this:


[[images/Linear2.png]]


This will create a 2-switch topology where each switch has a single connected host.

* Modify the application to have a unique MAC table for each connected switch

===== Extra Credit 1 - Tips =====
* Change the existing single Map macTable to a Map of macTables, indexed by the switch.
<dl><dd><pre>
    protected Map<IOFSwitch, Map<Long,Short>> macTables =
        new HashMap<IOFSwitch, Map<Long,Short>>();
</pre></dd></dl>
* You will need to create a macTable once for each switch, and store it into the macTables Map.  One good place to do this is in the ''addedSwitch'' method, which is called once when a new switch connects.
* In the ''forwardAsLearningSwitch'' method you will need to retrieve the proper macTable to use for the current ''OFPacketIn'', use the ''sw'' object as the key to retrieve it.

===== Extra Credit 1 - Testing =====
* Start Beacon
* Start Wireshark and turn on its capturing
* Start Mininet
 $ sudo mn --topo linear --switch ovsk --controller remote
* Wait for Beacon's console to report the switches have connected
* Run the pingall test
 mininet> pingall
* Check that the pings were successful
 *** Ping: testing ping reachability
 h1 -> h2 
 h2 -> h1 
 *** Results: 0% dropped (0/2 lost)

==== Extra Credit 2 ====
----
===== Extra Credit 2 - Overview =====
When OpenFlow switches send a Packet In to a controller they also typically keep a copy of the packet locally, with an assigned id - the ''buffer id'', which is also included in the Packet In message.  Some switches may not support buffering packets locally, or could be out of space to buffer additional packets.  In this case the 'buffer id' on a Packet In will be set to ''OFPacketOut.BUFFER_ID_NONE''.

In phase 2 when you send a Flow Mod to the switch it included the ''buffer id'' of the packet, and once the Flow Mod was installed the switch sent the packet with the provided ''buffer id''.  However this does not work if the packet has not been buffered.  The solution is to send a Flow Mod followed by a Packet Out that contains the actual packet data.  The Flow Mod's buffer id should be set to ''OFPacketOut.BUFFER_ID_NONE''.

* Modify the phase 2 code to send an ''OFPacketOut'' after the ''OFFlowMod'' when the OFPacketIn's ''buffer id'' is set to ''OFPacketOut.BUFFER_ID_NONE''

===== Extra Credit 2 - Tips =====
* After sending the Flow Mod from phase 2, test if the OFPacketIn's buffer id is none
<dl><dd><pre>
 if (pi.getBufferId() == OFPacketOut.BUFFER_ID_NONE) {
</pre></dd></dl>
* You'll need to create an ''OFPacketOut'' object much like you did in phase 1.
** Make sure you copy the packet data from the ''OFPacketIn'' to the ''OFPacketOut''
** Also ensure you set the ''OFActionOutput''s port to the outgoing port if known.

===== Extra Credit 2 - Testing =====
* Because the switches included in Mininet buffer all packets by default, you'll need to simulate this behavior in Beacon by modifying the actual ''OFPacketIn'' object and overwriting its ''buffer id''.  Add the following line of code right after the ''forwardAsLearningSwitch'' method declaration:
 pi.setBufferId(OFPacketOut.BUFFER_ID_NONE);


* Start Beacon
* Start Wireshark and turn on its capturing
* Start Mininet
 $ sudo mn --topo single,2 --switch ovsk --controller remote
* Wait for Beacon's console to report the switch has connected
* Send a single ping from h1 to h2 
 mininet> h1 ping -c1 h2
* Check that the ping was successful
 PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=1.68 ms

 --- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
 rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.683/1.683/1.683/0.000 ms

* Switch to your Wireshark view.  After the initial Packet In/Packet Out you should see all subsequent Packet In's followed by a Flow Mod and a Packet Out.  
* Note there is a bug in Wireshark currently that a single network packet containing both a Flow Mod and a Packet Out shows up in the Wireshark top view as only a Packet Out, if you select it then expand it in the bottom view you will see two OpenFlow packets, the Flow Mod followed by the Packet Out.
* The Flow Mod and Packet Out's ''buffer id'' should both be set to None, as seen in the following screenshot:
