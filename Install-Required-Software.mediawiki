You will need to download these files individually.

The files include virtualization software, a SSH-capable terminal, an X server, and the VM image.

The tutorial image is distributed as a compressed VirtualBox image (vdi).  VirtualBox enables you to run a virtual machine inside a physical machine, and is free and available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

== Download Files ==
You'll need to download the files corresponding to your OS, plus the tutorial VM.  

Start now with downloading a compressed VM image:

* [[Virtual Machine Image (OVF format, 64-bit, Mininet 2.0)|https://github.com/downloads/mininet/mininet/mininet-2.0.0-113012-amd64-ovf.zip]]

<span style="color: red">'''Important: For this VM image, the user name is 'mininet' with password 'mininet'.'''</span>

The download will take a while - it's on the order of 2GB in size.

You will also need to install VirtualBox version 4.2.10 or newer:
* [[VirtualBox|http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads]] 

== Install and Verify ==

After you have downloaded the Virtual Machine and VirtualBox, install VirtualBox and verify it is working for your platform.
