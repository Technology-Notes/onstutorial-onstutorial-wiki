You will need to acquire two files: a VirtualBox installer and the Tutorial VM.

'''If you are at the tutorial now, DO NOT use the wifi to download anything.'''  We will have CDs and USB keys with both files.  Download the files, then pass the key to a neighbor who needs it.

But, if you're looking to get stuff installed early to make sure they work on your system (great!) go ahead and download at will.

== Download Files ==

Start now with downloading a compressed VM image:

<span style="color: red">'''Update this with the final location!'''</span>

* [[Virtual Machine Image (OVF format, 64-bit, Mininet 2.0)|https://github.com/downloads/mininet/mininet/mininet-2.0.0-113012-amd64-ovf.zip]]

Downloading this VDI (a compressed VirtualBox image) will take a while - it's on the order of 1GB in size.

<span style="color: red">'''Important: For this VM image, the user name is 'mininet' with password 'mininet'.'''</span>

While that is downloading, grab VirtualBox version 4.2.10 or newer, for your particular OS:
* [[VirtualBox|http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads]] 

== Install and Verify ==

After you have downloaded VirtualBox, install it, then go to the next section, [[Set-Up-Virtual-Machine|Set Up Virtual Machine]] to verify that the VM is working on your platform.
