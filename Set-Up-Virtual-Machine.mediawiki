== Import Virtual Machine Image ==

Start up VirtualBox, then select File>Import Appliance and select the .ovf image that  you downloaded.

Next, press the "Import" button.  

This step will take a while - the unpacked image is about 3 GB.

'''If you are running Windows''', make sure to change the number of processors to 1, as VirtualBox v4.2.10 has a confusing bug where it reports a VT-X (virtualization hardware) error. Set the number of processors to 1, in Settings -> System -> Processor, to avoid this error.

Then, press the "Start" arrow icon or double-click your VM within the VirtualBox window. 

Once the VM starts you should see the desktop view for Lubuntu.  You can open a terminal by clicking inside the VM, then double clicking the Terminal icon in the top left corner, or pressing ctl-alt-t.

Make sure to read the command prompt notes below; they're important to knowing where to run each command.

== Important Command Prompt Notes ==
<font color=red>In this tutorial, commands are shown along with a command prompt to indicate the subsystem for which they are intended</font>. 

For example, 

 $ ls

indicates that the <code>ls</code> command should be typed at a Terminal command prompt within the VM, which generally ends in <code>$</code> if you are a regular user or <code>#</code> if you are root.

Other prompts used in this tutorial include 

 mininet>

for commands entered in the Mininet console.

Next, move on to [[Learn Development Tools]] to begin.
