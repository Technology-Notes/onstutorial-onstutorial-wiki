__TOC__

In this exercise, you will learn how to slice your OpenFlow network and have each slice controlled by a separate controller. In the process, you will also learn the concept of flowspaces and how the centralized visibility and “layerless-ness” of OpenFlow enables flexible slicing.

For this exercise we will use an open source tool called the FlowVisor.

==FlowVisor==

* FlowVisor is a special purpose OpenFlow controller that acts as a transparent proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers.
* FlowVisor creates rich slices of network resources and delegates control of each slice to a different controller. Slices can be defined by any combination of switch ports (layer 1), src/dst ethernet address or type (layer 2), src/dst IP address or type (layer 3), and src/dst TCP/UDP port or ICMP code/type (layer 4).
* FlowVisor enforces isolation between each slice, i.e., one slice cannot control another's traffic.

You can find more information about FlowVisor and source code at: [[http://www.flowvisor.org]]

==Exercise Topology==

In this exercise we will slice a wide-area network (WAN) in two different ways. The WAN shown in the figure above connects two sites. For simplicity, we’ll have each site represented by a single OpenFlow switch, s1 and s4, respectively. The sites, s1 and s4, have two paths between them: 
* a low bandwidth, low latency path via switch s2
* a high bandwidth, high latency path via switch s3

s1 has two hosts attached: h1 and h2. s2 has two hosts attached: h3 and h4.

==Environment Setup==

===Part1: Mininet Setup===

Before starting, we need to create the topology and make sure that it works. Open the file <tt>~/onstutorial/flowvisor_scripts/flowvisor_topo.py</tt>. This file contains the python code to create the topology below in mininet. Go ahead and run mininet with the following command: 
 sudo mn --custom ~/onstutorial/flowvisor_scripts/flowvisor_topo.py --topo fvtopo --link tc --controller remote --mac --arp

This will create a network in mininet with the WAN topology. To keep things simple, we have set static ARP entries in the mininet hosts.

===Part 2: FlowVisor Setup===

Next we will start FlowVisor and make sure that all the OpenFlow switches we just created connect to it. Start FlowVisor with the following command: 
 sudo /etc/init.d/flowvisor start
Ensure that FlowVisor is running by getting its configuration
 fvctl -f /dev/null get-config
slice and flowspace info: 
<tt>fvctl</tt> is a command-line utility to manage flowvisor. The <tt>-f</tt> argument points to a password file. Your FlowVisor is configured to be passwordless, therefore the password file is <tt>/dev/null</tt>.
List the existing slices and flowspaces using the following commands:
 fvctl -f /dev/null list-slices
 fvctl -f /dev/null list-flowspace
Ensure that all the switches have connected:
fvctl -f /dev/null list-datapaths
fvctl -f /dev/null list-links
