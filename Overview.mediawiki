In this tutorial, you'll turn the provided hub controller into a controller-based learning switch, then a flow-accelerated learning switch, and extend this from a single-switch network to a multiple-switch multiple-host network. You can also find guidelines for further extensions. Along the way, you'll learn the full suite of OpenFlow debugging tools.  You will:
* view flow tables with dpctl
* dissect OpenFlow message with Wireshark
* simulate a multi-switch, multi-host network with Mininet
* benchmark your controller with cbench

After the tutorial, you can apply what you've learned to physical networks based on software switches, NetFPGAs, or even hardware switches at line rate.

To get you started quickly, we provide a preconfigured virtual machine with the needed software.  

==Pre-requisites==
You will need a computer with at least 1GB (preferably 2GB+) of RAM and at least 5GB of free hard disk space (more preferred).  A faster processor may speed up the virtual machine boot time, and a larger screen may help to manage multiple terminal windows.

These instructions consider Linux, OS X, and Windows.  Linux and OS X are preferred - there's less to install.

You will need administrative access to the machine.

The tutorial instructions require no prior knowledge of OpenFlow.  The [[OpenFlow Learn More page|http://www.openflowswitch.org/wp/learnmore/]] is a concise introduction.

== Stuck?  Found a bug?  Questions?  ==
Email [openflow-discuss - at - lists.stanford.edu] if you're stuck, think you've found a bug, or just want to send some feedback.

If you are asking a question or reporting a bug, try to include as many details about your setup as possible.  Include your OS, virtualization software info, X11 and ssh software you're using, VM image you're using, memory size, and the step you're on.
